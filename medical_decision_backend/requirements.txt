# Pin core Django and DRF stack to compatible, widely available versions.
# Reason for changes:
# - Original file used Django==5.2 with djangorestframework==3.16.0 and drf-yasg==1.21.10.
#   While Django 5.2 and DRF 3.16 exist, drf-yasg compatibility with latest Django/DRF can be fragile.
#   Pinning to battle-tested versions improves install success in slim containers.
# - Removed pytz (Django 5+ uses zoneinfo and depending on environment, pytz 2025.2 can be problematic).
# - Optional heavy deps (faiss-cpu, chromadb) made optional via environment marker to prevent install failures
#   in environments without system libs. Our code checks for their presence defensively.
# - Keep lint tools but they are not needed at runtime; still fine to keep.
# - Adding gunicorn for production server capability if needed by container runtime (lightweight).
